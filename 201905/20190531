977. Squares of a Sorted Array:
     easy pass.

986. Interval List Intersections:
     three conditions: 
     1) A[index a]'s end smaller than B[index b]'s start, just increase index a.
     2) A[index a]'s start bigger than B[index b]'s end, just increase index b.
     3) intersect: calculate intersection.
