backtracking:

78. Combanations: simple

79. Word search:
    Noted that creating an additional array to store the cell that is visited before.

89. Grey code:
    bit manipulation: 
    <<: left shift
        1<<3 == 1*2^3 == 1*8
    >>: right shift
    ^:  XOR
        results in 1 only if both the compared bits have a different value, otherwise, it results in 0.
        Can be used to calculate lower digits.
        1000^1110 = 0110
        8^14 = 6
        
90. Subsets II:
    basic backtracking problem + checking if nums[i] and nums[i-1] is equal and just ignore it.
    
93. Restore IP addr:
    1
