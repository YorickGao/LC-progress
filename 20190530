828. Unique Letter String:
     
844. Backspace String Compare:
     O(n) space string builder solution: easy pass.
     O(1) space solution:
        - from back to front
        - if count > 0 && != #, skip
        - if count == 0 && different, return false
        - if #, count++
        - if one ends, the other count == 0 && has any char return false
        - else return true
