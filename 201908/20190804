DFS

947. Most Stones Removed with Same Row or Column
     DFS to count number of island. HashSet to store visited nodes.

959. Regions Cut By Slashes
     upscale the input grid to [n * 3][n * 3] grid and draw "lines" there. Then, we can paint empty regions using DFS and count 
     them. Note that [n * 2][n * 2] grid does not work as "lines" are too thick to identify empty areas correctly.
