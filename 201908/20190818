284. Peeking Iterator

423. Reconstruct Original Digits from English
     for zero, it's the only word has letter 'z',
     for two, it's the only word has letter 'w',
     ......
     so we only need to count the unique letter of each word, Coz the input is always valid.

477. Total Hamming Distance
     For each bit position 1-32 in a 32-bit integer, we count the number of integers in the array which have that bit set. 
     Then, if there are n integers in the array and k of them have a particular bit set and (n-k) do not, then that bit 
     contributes k*(n-k) hamming distance to the total.
