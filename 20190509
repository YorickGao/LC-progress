Binary Search

300. Longest Increasing Subsequence:
     Arrays.fill(int[] arr, int val) can fill the array with a certain value.
     
     1) O(n^2) DP solution:
     double while loop to update the LIS until dp[i] and return max value in dp[].
     
     2) O(nlogn) binary search solution:

315. Count of Smaller Numbers After Selfï¼š
     Arrays.asList() convert an array to arraylist.
     
     1) O(n^2) solution: same as DP solution in No.300.
     2) O(nlogn) solution: maintain a sorted array. For each iteration, find the insert position of nums[i] in the sorted
     array, then insert the nums[i] into the sorted array.
