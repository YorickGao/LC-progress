524. Longest Word in Dictionary through Deleting:
     1)sort the dictrionary:
     Collections.sort(d, (a,b) -> a.length() != b.length() ? -Integer.compare(a.length(), b.length()) :  a.compareTo(b));
    
     2)without sorting the dictionary:
     create a new string 'longest'. and update it when a longer word is found. Noticed that the answer should have the 
     smallest lexicographical order.

532. K-diff Pairs in an Array:
     sliding window.
     
567. Permutation in String:
     sliding window.
     
763. Partition Labels:
     building an array to store the last index of given character in the string s.
