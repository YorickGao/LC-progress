1039. Minimum Score Triangulation of Polygon
      dp[i][j] means the minimum score to triangulate A[i] ~ A[j], while there is edge connect A[i] and A[j].
      We enumerate all points A[k] with i < k < j to form a triangle.
      The score of this triangulation is min (dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k][j] + A[i] * A[j] * A[k]).
