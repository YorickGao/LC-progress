698. Partition to K Equal Sum Subsets
     dfs + backtracking
     Assume sum is the sum of nums[] . The dfs process is to find a subset of nums[] which sum equals to sum/k. 
     Each time when we get a cur_sum = sum/k, we will start from position 0 in nums[] to look up the elements that are not 
     used yet and find another cur_sum = sum/k.
