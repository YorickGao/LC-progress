971. Flip Binary Tree To Match Preorder Traversal
     Global integer i indicates next index in voyage v.
     If current node == null, it's fine, we return true
     If current node.val != v[i], doesn't match wanted value, return false
     If left child exist but don't have wanted value, flip it with right child.

993. Cousins in Binary Tree
     easy pass.
     
998. Maximum Binary Tree II
     If root.val > val, recusion on the right.
     Else, put right subtree on the left of new node TreeNode(val)
     
1008. Construct Binary Search Tree from Preorder Traversal
      Give the function a bound the maximum number it will handle.
      The left recursion will take the elements smaller than node.val
      The right recursion will take the remaining elements smaller than bound
      
1022. Sum of Root To Leaf Binary Numbers
      easy pass.
      
1026. Maximum Difference Between Node and Ancestor
      easy pass.

1028. Recover a Tree From Preorder Traversal
      save the construction path in a stack. In each loop, get the number level of '-' and the value val of node to add.
      If the size of stack is bigger than the level of node, pop the stack until it's not.
