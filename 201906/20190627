Tree

814. Binary Tree Pruning
     easy apss.
     
863. All Nodes Distance K in Binary Tree
     https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-subtree-with-all-the-deepest-nodes/discuss/146808/One-pass
     
872. Leaf-Similar Trees
     easy pass. Improvement: using stack is O(height) space.
     
889. Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Postorder Traversal

894. All Possible Full Binary Trees
     use DP (length is N + 1) to store middle results at dp[n] for a given N. In this case, middle result is a couple of
     full binary trees that have exactly N nodes. And iterate the dp array double looply you can construct full binary tree
     with more nodes.
     
897. Increasing Order Search Tree
     Iterative or recursive (faster)
     Don't forget to set left nodes pointing to null.

919. Complete Binary Tree Inserter
     we should use list to insert every node in dfs order. (size - 1) / 2 can get a node's parent.

938. Range Sum of BST
     easy pass.
