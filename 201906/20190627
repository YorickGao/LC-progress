894. All Possible Full Binary Trees
     use DP (length is N + 1) to store middle results at dp[n] for a given N. In this case, middle result is a couple of
     full binary trees that have exactly N nodes. And iterate the dp array double looply you can construct full binary tree
     with more nodes.
