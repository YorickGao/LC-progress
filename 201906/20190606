717. 1-bit and 2-bit Characters
     easy pass.
     
718. Maximum Length of Repeated Subarray
     same as longest common substring: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BysNXJHzCEs
     Tips: for a two dimensional DP solution, if you need create a dp[length m + 1][length n + 1], just padding the outter
     board using if(i == 0 || j == 0) dp[i][j] == 0 inside the double for loop.

719. Find K-th Smallest Pair Distance
     1) naive solution: store all of distance into an array. Then add them together until reach k.

729. My Calendar I
     use TreeMap. lowerKey(K key) returns the greatest key strictly less than the given key, or null if there is no such key.
     
746. Min Cost Climbing Stairs
     DP easy pass.
     
747. Largest Number At Least Twice of Others
