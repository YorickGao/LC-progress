768. Max Chunks To Make Sorted II
     same idea as 769 plus a limit variable.
     
775. Global and Local Inversions
     1) All local inversions are global inversions.
        If the number of global inversions is equal to the number of local inversions,
        it means that all global inversions in permutations are local inversions.
