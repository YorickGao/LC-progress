560. Subarray Sum Equals K
     1) O(n^2)
     num[i] indicates the sum at index i.
     
     2) O(n)

561. Array Partition I
     easy pass.
     
565. Array Nesting
     Since every number is distinct, there aren't any two elements pointed at the same index. So, set visited element to be -1
     is safe.
     
566. Reshape the Matrix
     easy pass.
     
581. Shortest Unsorted Continuous Subarray
     1) sorting the array
     2) two pass: find a min after the array is unsorted, and a max before the array is sorted. Second pass is finding the
     position of max and min.
     3) one pass: https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-unsorted-continuous-subarray/discuss/103066/

605. Can Place Flowers
     easy pass.
     
611. Valid Triangle Number
      once we sort the input array nums, the key to solve the problem is that given nums[k], count the combination of
      i and j where nums[i] + nums[j] > nums[k] (so that they can form a triangle). If nums[i] + nums[j] is larger than
      nums[k], we know that there will be j - i combination.
