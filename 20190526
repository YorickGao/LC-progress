Two pointers

3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters:
   keep a hashmap which stores the characters in string as keys and their positions as values, and keep two pointers which
   define the max substring. move the right pointer to scan through the string , and meanwhile update the hashmap. If the
   character is already in the hashmap, then move the left pointer to the right of the same character last found.

15. 3Sum:
    The idea is to sort an input array and then run through all indices of a possible first element of a triplet. For each
    possible first element we make a standard bi-directional 2Sum sweep of the remaining part of the array. Also we want to
    skip equal elements to avoid duplicates in the answer without making a set or smth like that.

    same as 3Sum.
