Binary search

154. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array II:
     basic idea is to remove the duplicates in the left side of the array, because in that case, like [3,3,1,3] where the
     left most element equals to the right most element will break our algprithm. So, we need to make sure there is only
     one element in the left side is euqal to the right most element ([3,1,3] will not effect our algorithm).
     
327. Count of Range Sum:
     Merge sort.
     
174. Dungeon Game:
     DP bottom up. Use Math.max/min to shorten the code. Notice that everytime the HP shouldn't lower than 1.
     DP + binary search also doable.
