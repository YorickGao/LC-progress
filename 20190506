backtracking problem

131. Palindrome Partitioning:
     DP + backtracking solution:
     use dp to determie if a substring is palindrome.
     
     pure backtracking solution:
     use isPalindrome function to check if a string is palindrome.
     
140. Word break II:
     Caution: TLE

216. Combination sum III:
     easy-pass

306. Additive number:
     using a for loop to generate two number, pass them into isAdditive function. Then recursively call isAdditive fucntion until the index reaches the end.

TrieNode:

211. Add and Search Word:
     A data structure called TrieNode to store its children and descendants.

212. Word search II:
     store string array into a trienode structure, then iterate char[][] board to search word.
